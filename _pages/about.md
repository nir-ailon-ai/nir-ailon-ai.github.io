After 20 years of academic work (including tenured professor at the Technion) and 
hands-on experience consulting for companies such as Google Research, Yahoo! Research, 
[pinecone.io](https://pinecone.io), [deci.ai](https://deci.ai), [owna.health](https://owna.health/tech), I have decided to move to beautiful Madrid. 
I now divide my time between consulting to companies on AI and machine learning, 
teaching and mentoring at [I.E university](https://ie.edu).

My main consulting expertise is in effectively leveraging AI tools with my 
clients' engineering process, from conducting experiments with generative AI 
for problem solving, to training and fine-tuning custom models for specific business needs.
